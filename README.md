## Projects

### Temporal Analysis of Heat Index Variability in Cebu City, Philippines: Insights from 2017-2023

Assessing the heat index of Cebu City for a span of 6 years, applying exploratory data analysis and time series in **Python** to explore patterns and trends for the past couple years and predict heat index values for the following years.


### Exscort - Disaster Navigation App

[Repository](https://github.com/ddextroo/exscort)

Developed a disaster navigation app using **Flutter**, **Firebase**, and **Google Maps API** that offers users the shortest and most optimal routes to their destinations. The app qualified as a Semi-Finalist for **Solve: Solutions Challenge Visayas**.

### Phytochemicals of _Euphorbia tirucalli_ and Their Inhibitory Potential Against _Xanthomonas oryzae_ Ddl Enzyme: An _In silico_ Evaluation for Potential Agrochemical

Conducted a molecular docking of 8 (eight) phytochemicals from _Euphorbia tirucalli_ onto the _Xanthomonas oryzae_ Ddl enzyme and evaluated their drug-likeness and toxicity risk. For the methodology, I acquired the appropriate structure data files of the proteins and ligands from databases such as **PubChem** and **RCSB Protein Data Bank**. To enhance efficiency, I utilized molecular docking softwares and web-based interfaces such as **AutoDock Vina**, **Avogadro**, **PyMol**, **LigPlot**, **SwissAdme**, and **Osiris Property Explorer**. The study revealed that **Afzelin** is a potential _Xanthomonas oryzae_ Ddl enzyme inhibitor with strong binding energy, drug-likeness, and no toxicity risks.

### VibroWake: Drowsy Detection System through Photoplethysmography

Fabricated a drowsiness detection system embedded in a watch-like device through **photoplethysmography technology**. We the researchers assessed the accuracy of heart beat detection by comparing our device to a standard pulse oximeter. The study revealed that VibroWake has an accuracy of **90.92%** against the standard pulse oximeter in terms of heart rate detection during different conditions such as sleeping, resting, and during motion.
